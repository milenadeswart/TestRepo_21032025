## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see [https://quarto.org](https://quarto.org).

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Meet the boys data 

The `boys` data from the [`mice`](https://github.com/amices/mice){.pkg} package is a random sample of 10% from the cross-sectional data used to construct the Dutch growth references 1997. Variables `gen` and `phb` are ordered factors. `reg` is a factor.

The following table shows the first 6 rows of the `boys` data.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
head(mice::boys)
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

::::


```{r}
#| file: "../scripts/read_data.R"
#| eval: true 
```

```{r}
head(boys)
``` 

#| code-overflow: wrap
Not every value in the `mice::boys` set is observed. This may pose problems with the analysis of the `boys` data. To get an idea about the problem, we can use missing data patterns. created the [`ggmice`](https://github.com/amices/ggmice){.pkg} package to create a [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org){.pkg} [@ggplot2] type plot of the missing values in the `boys` data.

```{r mdpattern}
library(mice)
library(ggmice)

# visualize ggplot2-like missing data pattern
mice::boys |> 
  ggmice::plot_pattern()
```
